# Debug Virtual File Approach

## Current Issues:
1. **Position mapping is broken** - "Cannot find name 'increment'" appearing on wrong element
2. **Complex position math** - Hard to get right
3. **Virtual file complexity** - Too many moving parts

## Your Insight is BRILLIANT:
Looking at your `testExpression()` function - when you hover over variables in there, you get perfect LSP!

## Simpler Alternative Approach:

Instead of complex position mapping, what if we:

1. **Create ONE virtual TS function per component** like your testExpression:
```typescript
function component_0() {
  // From x-data="{ count: 0, increment() {...} }"
  const count = 0;
  const increment = () => this.count++;

  // All Alpine expressions in this component:
  increment();        // from @click="increment()"
  count;             // from x-text="count"
  count === "test";  // from x-show="count === 'test'"
}
```

2. **Use simple line-by-line mapping**:
   - Line 5 in virtual = @click expression
   - Line 6 in virtual = x-text expression
   - Line 7 in virtual = x-show expression

3. **Map LSP results back by line number** (much simpler than character-level)

This would be:
- ✅ Much simpler position mapping
- ✅ Real TypeScript intelligence (like you see in testExpression)
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Less brittle
